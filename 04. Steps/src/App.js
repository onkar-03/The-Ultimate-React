/*
 --- Event Listeners in React
 - In React, we use a more declarative approach so we do not manually select Dom elements and so therefore we do also not use add event listener
 - We do something very similar to the HTML inline event listeners. So basically we will directly listen for the event right on the element where they will happen.
 - In React, event listeners are written as attributes in JSX
 - These attributes have a prefix 'on' and are camel-cased unlike HTML, and their values are callback functions that will be called when the event occurs inside {} as we need to write in Js mode inside JSX
 - We generally write these event handlers Functions separately inside the JSX and then call them in the Event Handlers
*/

/* 
 --- State in React
 - State is the most important concept in React
 - State refers to the general condition in which a component is
 - We have already learned how to pass data to a component using props
 - State is components own data that the component holds overtime, necessary for information that it needs to hold throughout the app's cycle
 - State: Components Memory
 - Piece of State: a State variable in a component
 - Updating component state triggers React to re-render the component
*/

/*
 --- What does state do ??
 - Updates the Components View
 - Persist local variables between renders & re-renders

// Exporting so as the index.js can use it where it is imported
