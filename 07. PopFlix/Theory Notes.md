## React Component Categories

In most React codebases, components generally fall into one of the following three categories:

1. **Stateless or Presentational Components**

   - **Definition:** These components do not have any state. They typically receive `props` and render content based on those `props`.
   - **Examples:** Logo, NumResults, and Movie components.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Usually small and simple.
     - Focus on how things look.
     - Reusable across the application.

2. **Stateful Components**

   - **Definition:** Components that manage and maintain their own state.
   - **Examples:** The Search component that handles user input.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Can still be highly reusable.
     - Focus on how things work.

3. **Structural Components**
   - **Definition:** Components that provide structure to the application, such as pages, layouts, or screens.
   - **Examples:** Page components, Layout components.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Can be large or small.
     - Often the result of composing smaller components together.
     - Provide the overall framework of the app.
