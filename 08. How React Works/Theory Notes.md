# Conceptual Difference Between React Components, Component Instances, and React Elements

## Introduction

In this section, we will explore the conceptual difference between React components, component instances, and React elements. Understanding this difference is crucial not only for grasping how components work in React but also because it's a common interview topic.

## What is a React Component?

- A React component is a JavaScript function that describes a piece of the user interface.
- This function returns React elements, often written using JSX syntax.
- A component can be thought of as a **blueprint** or **template** for the UI.

## Component Instances

When we use a component in our code, React creates one or multiple instances of that component. Each time a component is used, React calls the component function to create an instance.

- **Component Instance**: The actual / physical manifestation of a component within the component tree.
- **State & Props**: Each Instance has there own State and Props
- **Lifecycle**: Each component instance holds its own state and props and has its own lifecycle, similar to a living organism—it can be born, live for some time, and eventually die.

## React Elements

As React executes the code within each component instance, it returns one or more React elements.

- **Conversion**: JSX is converted into React Elements on function calls
- **React Element**: The result of using a component in the code, which is an immutable JavaScript object containing all necessary information to create DOM elements for the current component instance.

## Conversion to HTML DOM Elements

React elements are eventually converted to actual **HTML DOM elements** and painted onto the screen by the browser.

It’s important to note that React elements are not rendered directly to the DOM. They live inside the React app and are only converted to HTML DOM elements in the final step.

## Summary

The process begins with writing a single component and using it multiple times in our code as a blueprint. React then creates component instances, which generate React elements, and these are finally rendered as HTML elements in the DOM.
