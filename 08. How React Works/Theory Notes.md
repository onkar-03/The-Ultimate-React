## Conceptual Difference Between React Components, Component Instances, and React Elements

### Introduction

In this section, we will explore the conceptual difference between React components, component instances, and React elements. Understanding this difference is crucial not only for grasping how components work in React but also because it's a common interview topic.

### What is a React Component?

- A React component is a JavaScript function that describes a piece of the user interface.
- This function returns React elements, often written using JSX syntax.
- A component can be thought of as a **blueprint** or **template** for the UI.

### Component Instances

When we use a component in our code, React creates one or multiple instances of that component. Each time a component is used, React calls the component function to create an instance.

- **Component Instance**: The actual / physical manifestation of a component within the component tree.
- **State & Props**: Each Instance has there own State and Props
- **Lifecycle**: Each component instance holds its own state and props and has its own lifecycle, similar to a living organism—it can be born, live for some time, and eventually die.

### React Elements

As React executes the code within each component instance, it returns one or more React elements.

- **Conversion**: JSX is converted into React Elements on function calls
- **React Element**: The result of using a component in the code, which is an immutable JavaScript object containing all necessary information to create DOM elements for the current component instance.

### Conversion to HTML DOM Elements

React elements are eventually converted to actual **HTML DOM elements** and painted onto the screen by the browser.

It’s important to note that React elements are not rendered directly to the DOM. They live inside the React app and are only converted to HTML DOM elements in the final step.

### Summary

The process begins with writing a single component and using it multiple times in our code as a blueprint. React then creates component instances, which generate React elements, and these are finally rendered as HTML elements in the DOM.

If you found this explanation interesting and useful, let's move on to the next video and take a look at this process in code.

## Why Shouldn't We Call Components Directly in React?

In React, components are typically rendered using JSX syntax, like `<MyComponent />`. When you write this, React internally calls the component function and creates a **React element**. This React element is then used by React to manage and update the DOM efficiently.

When you use JSX, like `<DifferentContent />`, React automatically calls the `DifferentContent` function behind the scenes. This function returns a React element, which is essentially an object containing important details about the component, such as its type (in this case, `DifferentContent`) and any props passed to it.

React relies on this information to manage how components are rendered and updated in the DOM. This process allows React to handle complex UI updates efficiently and ensure that components behave as expected.

If you directly call a component function instead of using JSX, React doesn’t recognize it as a component instance. Instead, it just treats the output as a plain React element, which can lead to issues such as the component not managing its state properly or hooks behaving incorrectly. Therefore, it’s important to always use JSX syntax to let React handle components correctly.

However, when you call a component directly as a function, like `DifferentContent()`, the following issues arise:

1. **Loss of Component Identity**:

   - The element returned is no longer treated as a React component but rather as a regular HTML element (e.g., a `div`).
   - This means React doesn't recognize it as a component instance, leading to loss of key features like component-specific state and lifecycle methods.

2. **State Management Issues**:

   - In React, each component instance can manage its own state. When you call a component directly, React can't associate the state with a specific component instance.
   - This is demonstrated in the transcript where the state of the `tabContent` component ends up being managed by its parent component, which is not the intended behavior.

3. **Violating the Rules of Hooks**:
   - React has strict rules around how hooks should be used, especially that they must be called at the top level of a component. Calling a component directly can lead to violations of these rules, causing unexpected behavior or errors.

In conclusion, always render components using JSX syntax (`<ComponentName />`). This ensures that React recognizes the component as an instance, correctly manages its state, and adheres to the rules of hooks.
